My Tool Box - WIP
====
**Objective** 

I wanted to create a page to share all the helpful resources we have used during our web design course.

There is so much information online, it's sometimes hard to know where to start. 

This is a tool for anyone who is keen to start learning the basics of web design.

Enjoy!
